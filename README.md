# Battleship Game

Hello freakin' sweet people! This here's a console-based version of that game you played as a kid - yep, that's right, it's Battleship! 
Now you can sink ships from the comfort of your computer. It's all computery and stuff, so here's how you get it runnin':

## Installation

1. First, make sure you've got .NET installed on your computer. If you don't, head on over to the [Microsoft .NET download page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) and download the latest version. It's kinda like tryin' to make a PB&J without the J, just doesn't work.

2. Once you've got .NET, you're gonna have to download this game. Click on the green `Code` button on the top right of this page and select `Download ZIP`. It's like that time I downloaded the beer delivery app - so convenient!

3. After you've downloaded the ZIP file, extract it somewhere nice and comfy on your computer. 

4. Next, open your terminal or command prompt and mosey on over to the directory where you extracted the game. 

5. Once you're in the game directory, type `dotnet run` and hit Enter. The game should start up.


## How to Play

1. When the game starts, you'll see a 10x10 grid. This is your battlefield. It's like that time we played paintball in the park, except less messy.

2. The game will prompt you to enter coordinates. You're gonna type something like `A5` or `B7`, where the letter is the row and the number is the column. It's like Battleship bingo!

3. After you enter your coordinates, you'll either hit a ship (sweet!) or you won't (dang!). If you hit a ship, you'll see a message telling you so.

4. Keep on guessing coordinates until you've sunk all the ships. It's like that game of Whack-A-Mole at the carnival, except less frustrating.

5. If you manage to sink all the ships, you win! Celebrate with a cold one, just like I do at the end of...well, just about anything, really.

Now get out there and sink some ships! And remember, as the great Uncle Ben once said, "With great power comes great responsibility".
